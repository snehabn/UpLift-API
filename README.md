Why create Uplift?

Uplift enables volunteers and organizations/opportunities to be matched based on skills and/or interests. We have provided a platform that currently allows volunteers to search for volunteering opportunities based on skills/interests, locations, and organizations.

We are facilitating the search for volunteering opportunities via better UX and search criteria with an emphasis on skills desired.
